    <p>India, officially the Republic of India,it is located in South Asia. It isthe seventh-largest country by area,
        the second-most populous country, and the most popular democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on
        the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with
        Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the
        Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a
        marine border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia. The nation's capital city is New Delhi.
        Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.Their long
        occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse,
        second only to Africa in human genetic diversity. Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western
        margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the
        third millennium BCE. By 1200 BCE,
        an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest.Its evidence
        today is found in the hymns of the Rigveda. Preserved by a resolutely vigilant oral tradition, the Rigveda
        records the dawning of Hinduism in India. The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and
        western regions. By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism, and Buddhism and
        Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity. Early political consolidations gave rise to
        the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges
        Basin.Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity, but also marked by the declining status of
        women, and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised
        system of belief. In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious
        cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia. In the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and
        Zoroastrianism became established on India's southern and western coasts. Muslim armies from Central Asia
        intermittently overran India's northern plains, eventually founding the Delhi Sultanate In the 15th century, the
        Vijayanagar Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India. In the Punjab, Sikhism
        emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion. The Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative
        peace, leaving a legacy of luminous architecture.Gradually expanding rule of the British East India Company
        followed, turning India into a colonial economy,
        but also consolidating its sovereignty. British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were
        granted slowly, but technological changes were introduced, and modern ideas of education and the public life
        took root. A pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged, which was noted for nonviolent resistance
        and became the major factor in ending British rule. In 1947 the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two
        independent dominions, a Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan, amid
        large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration. India has been a federal republic since 1950, governed
        through a democratic parliamentary system. It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's
        population grew from 361 million in 1951 to 1.211 billion in 2011. During the same time, its nominal per capita
        income increased from US$64 annually to US$1,498, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From being a
        comparatively destitute country in 1951, India has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for information
        technology services, with an expanding middle class. It has a space
        programme which includes several planned or completed extraterrestrial missions. Indian movies, music, and
        spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture. India has substantially reduced its rate of
        poverty, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality. India is a nuclear-weapon state, which ranks high
        in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since
        the mid-20th century. Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,
        and rising levels of air pollution. India's land is megadiverse, with four biodiversity
        hotspots. Its forest cover comprises 21.7% of its area. India's wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed
        with tolerance in India's culture, is supported among these forests, and elsewhere, in protected habitats.
